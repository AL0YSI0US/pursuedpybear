   <h2>A Game Engine</h2>
   <p> The core features provided by PPB are perfect for making games! The <code>GameEngine</code> itself provides a pluggable subsystem architecture where adding new features is as simple as subclassing and extending <code>System</code>. Additionally, it contains a state stack of <code>Scenes</code> simple containers that let you organize game scenes and UI screens in a simple way. </p>

        <td class="tg-0lax">A project built on ppb should look like idiomatic Python. It also should look like modern Python. As such, we often add new language features as soon as they’re available, letting a new user always know ppb runs on the latest Python.</td>

        <td class="tg-0lax">ppb games are built out of instances of objects. Each object only has enough information to respond to the event provided, which always includes the current BaseScene. Because ppb doesn’t have a master list of events, you can provide new ones simply to add more granular control over your game.</td>
        <td class="tg-0lax">Because ppb strongly tries to be extensible and pluggable, each hardware extension can provide its own hooks to ppb, and you can nearly seamlessly switch between various Python libraries.</td>

A new user should be able to build their first game in a few hours and continue exploring beyond that.</td>
