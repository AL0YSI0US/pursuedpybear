Community Values
===================

This section will be about the values that the ``ppb`` community should strive
for.


Values
------

We have a Code of Conduct marking the minimum buy in to ``ppb`` culture,
but these values are aspirational and goals for the community.

Radical Acceptance
+++++++++++++++++++

This is about diversity. The author of ``ppb`` is a white trans lesbian with a
non-traditional education background. We welcome everyone from everywhere. We
want you involved.

No Contempt Culture
++++++++++++++++++++

Python for game development is scoffed at by many professionals. This culture of
contempt is often discouraging for new developers who find a tool they love only
to listen to how bad it is. In pursuit of radical acceptance, we want to avoid
contempt culture.

Strong opinions are fine. Every member of the core developers has strong
opinions on software. Being opinionated is appreciated, but don't share your
contempt for given software or tools here.
