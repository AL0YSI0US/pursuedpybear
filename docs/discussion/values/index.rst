Principles and Values
=========================

When ``ppb`` started it was given a set of principles that would guide it's
first few years. Those principles are:

* Education Friendly
* Idiomatic Python
* Object Oriented and Event Driven
* Hardware Library Agnostic
* Fun

They've been great and we still stand by them, but the project has grown and so
new values are needed. These will be loosely sorted into governance,  community
values and technical values.
