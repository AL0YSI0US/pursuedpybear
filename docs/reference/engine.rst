The ``GameEngine`` is the literal beating heart of ppb: It's the publisher for
the event and messaging system, is the source of the ``Idle`` event, and is the
root container of the object tree.

Some of the engine of the API is definitely intended for advanced users. Use
the various methods of GameEngine with caution.
