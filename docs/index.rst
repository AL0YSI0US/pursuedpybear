Welcome to PursuedPyBear's documentation!
=========================================

PursuedPyBear, also known as :code:`ppb`, exists to be an educational resource. Most obviously used to teach computer science, it can be a useful tool for any topic that a simulation can be helpful. At its core, :code:`ppb` provides a number of features that make it perfect for video games. The :code:`GameEngine` itself provides a pluggable subsystem architecture where adding new features is as simple as subclassing and extending :code:`System`.
